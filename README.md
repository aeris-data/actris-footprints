# ACTRIS-footprints

ACTRIS-FR [[1]] is the French component of ACTRIS for the observation and exploration of aerosols, clouds and reactive gasses and their interactions. ACTRIS operates central platforms (data and calibration centers) and provides services intended for a large community of users working on chemistry/climate models, on the validation of satellite data or on the analysis of weather forecasting or of air quality.

The objective of this project is to set up a chain of systematic application of FLEXPART and the SOFT-IO tools to the in-situ measurement stations of ACTRIS-France with the development of a subsequent visualization tool. FLEXPART [[2]] is a Lagrangian particle dispersion model which makes it possible to estimate the backward trajectories of plumes of aerosol or gas particles. SOFT-IO (“Source attribution using FLEXPART and carbon monoxide emission inventories”) [[3]] is a tool developed within SEDOO department of the Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées by Pawel WOLFF which allows the estimation of the geographical origin of pollutants and emission sources which are at origin of CO increases in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. Combined with the in-situ measurements of the stations, the products provided by these two tools will serve as a complement for the data analyzes and atmospheric monitoring that SEDOO-AERIS would like to set up and offer to its users.
